## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed punctuation, converted to lowercase, formatted date columns  
2. **NLP Preprocessing** – Used TF-IDF to convert text into numerical vectors  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Split dataset into train and test sets, saved for reuse  
4. **Model Training** – Trained Logistic Regression on vectorized data  
5. **Evaluation** – Calculated accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  
6. **Visualization** – Built Power BI dashboard with model output and insights

This GitHub repository reflects my personal reimplementation and visualization of the original idea. I built the entire workflow independently — from text processing and model training to Power BI integration — to deepen my understanding and showcase it as part of my portfolio.

🙏 Grateful to my guide and teammates for their contribution to the original version.
